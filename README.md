# Toxic-Comment-Classification

The internet has opened up a Pandora’s Box of unforeseen issues. Cyberbullying is one
of them which has gained prominence in recent times. Social media is riddled with
offensive comments which impact people negatively. Identifying such comments have
become of the utmost importance. This project aims to explore various machine
learning approaches (both traditional and deep learning) for detecting toxic
comments. We study the impact Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic
Regression (LR), K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), NB-LR, Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Bi-directional Long Short-Term
Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) on identifying toxicity in text. We evaluated our approaches
on Wikipedia comments from the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification dataset.
